# FileComparer
This is a small little program I made that compares all files within the same directory and outputs the ratio of matched characters.
The main command is "compare".

It'll only compare 2 files at a time and output their matching ratio.
The ratio (%) next to each file (right side) is the amount of characters in the file that matches the other file.
